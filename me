As a backend engineer at a startup, I demonstrated a strong grasp of Java EE technologies, including application servers, servlet containers, and JMS. I used my excellent OOP skills to transform requirements into scalable software designs, and I was involved in the design and development of a highly scalable and configurable pricing platform within the PayPal payment system.

In my role, I implemented APIs, designed backend low-level architecture, and built microservices from scratch. I took complete ownership of the task management service for the internal team for credit collection, which helped to optimize processes and improve overall efficiency. I integrated a payment link into the payment gateway flow, which resulted in a drastic reduction of calls and an improvement in customer experience.

One of my major achievements was building an agnostic onboarding system that allowed the company to onboard customers to different lenders. This project is projected to increase the portfolio by 40%, and I am proud to have taken complete ownership of it.

Throughout my work, I demonstrated a commitment to quality and a strong advocate for code craftsmanship. I implemented best practices such as unit testing, test automation, and continuous integration. I also optimized APIs, managed customer issues, and maintained version control for collaboration.

My work as a backend engineer was characterized by my high level of curiosity, passion for technology, pride of ownership, and a constant strive for excellence. I believe my work helped the company achieve its goals and positioned it for future growth.
